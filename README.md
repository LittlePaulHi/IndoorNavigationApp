[![Build status](https://build.appcenter.ms/v0.1/apps/99e6fb9e-fe8c-49df-b190-8aa1732a0ad2/branches/master/badge)](https://appcenter.ms)

- Waypoint-based navigator is a mobile Bluetooth navigation application that runs on both Android and iOS platforms.
- It is structured to support anywhere navigation indoors in areas covered by different indoor positioning system (IPS) and outdoors covered by GPS. In particular, it can rely on BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) for indoor positioning.
- The IPS provides a location beacon at every waypoint. The beacon broadcasts its own coordinates; Consequently, the navigator does not need to continuously monitor its own position.
