 *      destination, and user preferences. When in navigation, the class will 
 *      give the next waypoint, and when the user is in the wrong way, the 
 *      class will re-route.

 * Abstract:
 *
 *      Waypoint-based navigator is a mobile Bluetooth navigation application
 *      that runs on smart phones. It is structed to support anywhere 
 *      navigation. Indoors in areas covered by different indoor positioning 
 *      system (IPS) and outdoors covered by GPS. In particilar, it can rely on 
 *      BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) for indoor 
 *      positioning. Using this IPS, the navigator does not need to 
 *      continuously monitor its own position, since the IPS broadcast to the 
 *      navigator the location of each waypoint. 
 *      This version makes use of Xamarin.Forms, which is a complete 
 *      cross-platform UI tookit that runs on both iOS and Android.
