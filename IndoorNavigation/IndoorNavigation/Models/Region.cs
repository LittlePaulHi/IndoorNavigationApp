 *
 *      Waypoint-based navigator is a mobile Bluetooth navigation application
 *      that runs on smart phones. It is structed to support
 *      anywhere navigation. Indoors in areas covered by different
 *      indoor positioning system (IPS) and outdoors covered by GPS.
 *      In particilar, it can rely on BeDIS (Building/environment Data and
 *      Information System) for indoor positioning. 
 *      Using this IPS, the navigator does not need to continuously monitor
 *      its own position, since the IPS broadcast to the navigator the
 *      location of each waypoint.
 *      This version makes use of Xamarin.Forms, which is a complete 
 *      cross-platform UI tookit that runs on both iOS and Android.
